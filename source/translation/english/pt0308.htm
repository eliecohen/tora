["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the \nanointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, \nand the basket of unleavened bread;\n","and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.'\n","And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.\n","And Moses said unto the congregation: 'This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded to be done.'\n","And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\n","And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, \nand clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded\n him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him \ntherewith.\n","And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.\n","And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in \nfront, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD \ncommanded Moses.\n","And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.\n","And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and \nanointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to \nsanctify them.\n","And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.\n","And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with tunics, \nand girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as the \nLORD commanded Moses.\n","And the bullock of the sin-offering was brought; and Aaron and\n his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the \nsin-offering.\n","And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon \nthe horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the \naltar, and poured out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and \nsanctified it, to make atonement for it.\n","And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the \nlobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it\n smoke upon the altar.\n","But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n","And the ram of the burnt-offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n","And when it was killed, Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about.\n","And when the ram was cut into its pieces, Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke.\n","And when the inwards and the legs were washed with water, \nMoses made the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering \nfor a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as \nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n","And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\n","And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood thereof, and \nput it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his \nright hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.\n","And Aaron's sons were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon\n the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and\n upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood \nagainst the altar round about.\n","And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that \nwas upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, \nand their fat, and the right thigh.\n","And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the\n LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one\n wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh.\n","And he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the \nhands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before the LORD.\n","And Moses took them from off their hands, and made them smoke \non the altar upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering \nfor a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n","And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering \nbefore the LORD; it was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as \nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n","And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which \nwas upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, \nand upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified \nAaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.\n","And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: 'Boil the flesh at \nthe door of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is \nin the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his \nsons shall eat it.\n","And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.\n","And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting \nseven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He \nshall consecrate you seven days.\n","As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.\n","And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and \nnight seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for \nso I am commanded.\n","And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. {S}\n"]
