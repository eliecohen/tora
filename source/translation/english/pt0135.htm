["And God said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell \nthere; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when \nthou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.'\n","Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with \nhim: 'Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify \nyourselves, and change your garments;\n","and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there \nan altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was \nwith me in the way which I went.'\n","And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in \ntheir hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them \nunder the terebinth which was by Shechem.\n","And they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities \nthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of \nJacob.\n","So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan--the same is Beth-el--he and all the people that were with him.\n","And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el, \nbecause there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of \nhis brother.\n","And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. {P}\n","And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.\n","And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not \nbe called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called \nhis name Israel.\n","And God said unto him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and \nmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings \nshall come out of thy loins;\n","and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.'\n","And God went up from him in the place where He spoke with him.\n","And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with \nhim, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and \npoured oil thereon.\n","And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.\n","And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way \nto come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\n","And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the mid-wife said unto her: 'Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.'\n","And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing--for she \ndied--that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him \nBenjamin.\n","And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath--the same is Beth-lehem.\n","And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.\n","And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder.\n","And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that \nReuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard\n of it. {P} Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:\n","the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;\n","the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;\n","and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;\n","and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.\n","And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriatharba--the same is Hebron--where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n","And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.\n","And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. {P}\n"]
