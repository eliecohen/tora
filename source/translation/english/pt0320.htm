["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel: Whosoever \nhe be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in \nIsrael, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to \ndeath; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.\n","I also will set My face against that man, and will cut him off \nfrom among his people, because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to\n defile My sanctuary, and to profane My holy name.\n","And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from \nthat man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to \ndeath;\n","then I will set My face against that man, and against his \nfamily, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go \nastray after Molech, from among their people.\n","And the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the \nfamiliar spirits, to go astray after them, I will even set My face \nagainst that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.\n","Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am the LORD your God.\n","And keep ye My statutes, and do them: I am the LORD who sanctify you.\n","For whatsoever man there be that curseth his father or his \nmother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his \nmother; his blood shall be upon him.\n","And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, \neven he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, both the \nadulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\n","And the man that lieth with his father's wife--he hath \nuncovered his father's nakedness--both of them shall surely be put to \ndeath; their blood shall be upon them.\n","And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall \nsurely be put to death; they have wrought corruption; their blood shall \nbe upon them.\n","And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them\n have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their \nblood shall be upon them.\n","And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is \nwickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there \nbe no wickedness among you.\n","And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast.\n","And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, \nthou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to \ndeath; their blood shall be upon them.\n","And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or \nhis mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness:\n it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the \nchildren of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he \nshall bear his iniquity.\n","And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and \nshall uncover her nakedness--he hath made naked her fountain, and she \nhath uncovered the fountain of her blood--both of them shall be cut off \nfrom among their people.\n","And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's \nsister, nor of thy father's sister; for he hath made naked his near kin;\n they shall bear their iniquity.\n","And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife--he hath \nuncovered his uncle's nakedness--they shall bear their sin; they shall \ndie childless.\n","And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.\n","Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all Mine \nordinances, and do them, that the land, whither I bring you to dwell \ntherein, vomit you not out.\n","And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am\n casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I \nabhorred them.\n","But I have said unto you: 'Ye shall inherit their land, and I \nwill give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and \nhoney.' I am the LORD your God, who have set you apart from the peoples.\n","Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and the \nunclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and ye shall not \nmake your souls detestable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing \nwherewith the ground teemeth, which I have set apart for you to hold \nunclean.\n","And ye shall be holy unto Me; for I the LORD am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine.\n","A man also or a woman that divineth by a ghost or a familiar \nspirit, shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones;\n their blood shall be upon them. {P}\n"]
