["And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and \nsaid unto him: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n","Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's \nfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy \nmother's brother.\n","And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a congregation of peoples;\n","and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed\n with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which \nGod gave unto Abraham.'\n","And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram unto \nLaban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and \nEsau's mother.\n","Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to \nPaddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him \nhe gave him a charge, saying: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the \ndaughters of Canaan';\n","and that Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram;\n","and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n","so Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had \nMahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, \nto be his wife. {S}\n","And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.\n","And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, \nbecause the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and\n put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n","And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and \nthe top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending \nand descending on it.\n","And, behold, the LORD stood beside him, and said: 'I am the \nLORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land \nwhereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.\n","And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt\n spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to \nthe south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the \nearth be blessed.\n","And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever \nthou goest, and will bring thee back into this land; for I will not \nleave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.'\n","And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said: 'Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.'\n","And he was afraid, and said: 'How full of awe is this place! \nthis is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of \nheaven.'\n","And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone \nthat he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured \noil upon the top of it.\n","And he called the name of that place Beth-el, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.\n","And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: 'If God will be with me, and \nwill keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and \nraiment to put on,\n","so that I come back to my father's house in peace, then shall the LORD be my God,\n","and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be \nGod's house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the \ntenth unto Thee.'\n"]
