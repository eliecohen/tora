["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and \nencamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before \nBaal-zephon, over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.\n","And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n","And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after \nthem; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; and \nthe Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.' And they did so.\n","And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled; \nand the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the \npeople, and they said: 'What is this we have done, that we have let \nIsrael go from serving us?\n","And he made ready his chariots, and took his people with him.\n","And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.\n","And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and \nhe pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went\n out with a high hand.\n","And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and \nchariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them \nencamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.\n","And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up \ntheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and \nthey were sore afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the \nLORD.\n","And they said unto Moses: 'Because there were no graves in \nEgypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast \nthou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?\n","Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying:\n Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for \nus to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.'\n","And Moses said unto the people: 'Fear ye not, stand still, and\n see the salvation of the LORD, which He will work for you to-day; for \nwhereas ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no \nmore for ever.\n","The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.' {P}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Wherefore criest thou unto Me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.\n","And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the \nsea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst \nof the sea on dry ground.\n","And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and \nthey shall go in after them; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and \nupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n","And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have \ngotten Me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his \nhorsemen.'\n","And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, \nremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from \nbefore them, and stood behind them;\n","and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; \nand there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet gave it light by \nnight there; and the one came not near the other all the night.\n","And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD \ncaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made \nthe sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n","And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon\n the dry ground; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right \nhand, and on their left.\n","And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the \nmidst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\n","And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the LORD looked\n forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of \ncloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.\n","And He took off their chariot wheels, and made them to drive \nheavily; so that the Egyptians said: 'Let us flee from the face of \nIsrael; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.' {P}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Stretch out thy hand over the \nsea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their \nchariots, and upon their horsemen.'\n","And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea \nreturned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians \nfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of \nthe sea.\n","And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the \nhorsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the \nsea; there remained not so much as one of them.\n","But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst \nof the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, \nand on their left.\n","Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.\n","And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did upon the \nEgyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the \nLORD, and in His servant Moses. {P}\n"]
