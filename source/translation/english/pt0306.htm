["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the \nburnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar\n all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept \nburning thereby.\n","And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen \nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes \nwhereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he \nshall put them beside the altar.\n","And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\n","And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it \nshall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; \nand he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make \nsmoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.\n","Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out. {S}\n","And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar.\n","And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour \nof the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense \nwhich is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part \nthereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n","And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it\n shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent\n of meeting they shall eat it.\n","It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their \nportion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the \nsin-offering, and as the guilt-offering.\n","Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due\n for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the LORD \nmade by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they \nshall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part\n of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it \nin the morning, and half thereof in the evening.\n","On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, \nthou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the \nmeal-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n","And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among \nhis sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made \nto smoke unto the LORD.\n","And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of \nthe sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall \nthe sin-offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.\n","The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.\n","Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and \nwhen there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou \nshalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.\n","But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; \nand if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed \nin water.\n","Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy.\n","And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into \nthe tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten;\n it shall be burnt with fire. {P}\n"]
