["Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said: 'My father and \nmy brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, \nare come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of\n Goshen.'\n","And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.\n","And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: 'What is your occupation?' \nAnd they said unto Pharaoh: 'Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and \nour fathers.'\n","And they said unto Pharaoh: 'To sojourn in the land are we \ncome; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine \nis sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy \nservants dwell in the land of Goshen.'\n","And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: 'Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee;\n","the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make \nthy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them \ndwell. And if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them \nrulers over my cattle.'\n","And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n","And Pharaoh said unto Jacob: 'How many are the days of the years of thy life?'\n","And Jacob said unto Pharaoh: 'The days of the years of my \nsojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the \ndays of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days \nof the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their \nsojournings.'\n","And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.\n","And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a\n possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land \nof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n","And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his\n father's household, with bread, according to the want of their little \nones.\n","And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was \nvery sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished \nby reason of the famine.\n","And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the \nland of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they \nbought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n","And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in \nthe land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said: 'Give \nus bread; for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.'\n","And Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you [bread] for your cattle, if money fail.'\n","And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave \nthem bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the \nherds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread in exchange for all\n their cattle for that year.\n","And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second \nyear, and said unto him: 'We will not hide from my lord, how that our \nmoney is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is \nnought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.\n","Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our \nland? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen\n unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that\n the land be not desolate.'\n","So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the \nEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon \nthem; and the land became Pharaoh's.\n","And as for the people, he removed them city by city, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n","Only the land of the priests bought he not, for the priests \nhad a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave\n them; wherefore they sold not their land.\n","Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have bought you \nthis day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye \nshall sow the land.\n","And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall \ngive a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of\n the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for \nfood for your little ones.'\n","And they said: 'Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen.'\n","And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto\n this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the \npriests alone became not Pharaoh's.\n","And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; \nand they got them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied\n exceedingly.\n","And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the \ndays of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven \nyears.\n","And the time drew near that Israel must die; and he called his\n son Joseph, and said unto him: 'If now I have found favour in thy \nsight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and \ntruly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.\n","But when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of \nEgypt, and bury me in their burying-place.' And he said: 'I will do as \nthou hast said.'\n","And he said: 'Swear unto me.' And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed down upon the bed's head. {P}\n"]
