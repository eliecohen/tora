["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When a \nman shall clearly utter a vow of persons unto the LORD, according to thy\n valuation,\n","then thy valuation shall be for the male from twenty years old \neven unto sixty years old, even thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of \nsilver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.\n","And if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels.\n","And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, \nthen thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels, and for the \nfemale ten shekels.\n","And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then \nthy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the \nfemale thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.\n","And if it be from sixty years old and upward: if it be a male, \nthen thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten \nshekels.\n","But if he be too poor for thy valuation, then he shall be set \nbefore the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the \nmeans of him that vowed shall the priest value him. {S}\n","And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.\n","He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a \nbad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both\n it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.\n","And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an\n offering unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest.\n","And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.\n","But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy valuation.\n","And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the \nLORD, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the \npriest shall value it, so shall it stand.\n","And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he \nshall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it \nshall be his.\n","And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of\n his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing \nthereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty \nshekels of silver.\n","If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand.\n","But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the \npriest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that \nremain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy\n valuation.\n","And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, \nthen he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, \nand it shall be assured to him.\n","And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.\n","But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy\n unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the \npriest's.\n","And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;\n","then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy \nvaluation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in \nthat day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.\n","In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom\n it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land \nbelongeth.\n","And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.\n","Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a \nfirstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or \nsheep, it is the LORD'S.\n","And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it \naccording to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part \nthereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to \nthy valuation.\n","Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto \nthe LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field \nof his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is \nmost holy unto the LORD.\n","None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.\n","And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the \nland, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S; it is holy unto the \nLORD.\n","And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.\n","And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.\n","He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall \nhe change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for \nwhich it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.\n","These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. {P}\u00a0\n"]
