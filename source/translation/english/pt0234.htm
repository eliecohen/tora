["And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Hew thee two tables of stone \nlike unto the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that \nwere on the first tables, which thou didst break.\n","And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto \nmount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount.\n","And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen\n throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before \nthat mount.'\n","And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses\n rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD\n had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.\n","And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n","And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The LORD, \nthe LORD, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in \ngoodness and truth;\n","keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving \niniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the \nguilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon\n the children's children, unto the third and unto the fourth \ngeneration.'\n","And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.\n","And he said: 'If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O Lord, \nlet the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a \nstiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for\n Thine inheritance.'\n","And He said: 'Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people\n I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor \nin any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the \nwork of the LORD that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous.\n","Observe thou that which I am commanding thee this day; behold,\n I am driving out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the \nHittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n","Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the \ninhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in \nthe midst of thee.\n","But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim.\n","For thou shalt bow down to no other god; for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God;\n","lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, \nand they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, \nand they call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice;\n","and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their \ndaughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after \ntheir gods.\n","Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n","The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou\n shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed \nin the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\n","All that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males, the firstlings of ox and sheep.\n","And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and\n if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the \nfirst-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before \nMe empty.\n","Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n","And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the \nfirst-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn \nof the year.\n","Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.\n","For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy \nborders; neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to \nappear before the LORD thy God three times in the year.\n","Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened \nbread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left \nunto the morning.\n","The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto \nthe house of the LORD thy God.
