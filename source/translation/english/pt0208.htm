["And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch forth \nthy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the \npools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.'\n","And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\n","And the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.\n","Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: 'Entreat the\n LORD, that He take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I \nwill let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the LORD.'\n","And Moses said unto Pharaoh: 'Have thou this glory over me; \nagainst what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and \nfor thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, \nand remain in the river only?'\n","And he said: 'Against to-morrow.' And he said: 'Be it according\n to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the \nLORD our God.\n","And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and \nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river \nonly.'\n","And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto\n the LORD concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh.\n","And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs \ndied out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.\n","And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.\n","But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken. {S}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy\n rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats \nthroughout all the land of Egypt.'\n","And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his \nrod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats upon man, and\n upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the \nland of Egypt.\n","And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth\n gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon \nbeast.\n","Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: 'This is the finger of \nGod'; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; \nas the LORD had spoken. {S}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Rise up early in the morning, \nand stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto\n him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.\n","Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send \nswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, \nand into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of \nswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.\n","And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which \nMy people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end that\n thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\n","And I will put a division between My people and thy people--by to-morrow shall this sign be.'\n","And the LORD did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies \ninto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses; and in all the\n land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies.\n","And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said: 'Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.'\n","And Moses said: 'It is not meet so to do; for we shall \nsacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God; lo, if \nwe sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will \nthey not stone us?\n","We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as He shall command us.'\n","And Pharaoh said: 'I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to\n the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far \naway; entreat for me.'\n","And Moses said: 'Behold, I go out from thee, and I will \nentreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from \nhis servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal \ndeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the \nLORD.'\n","And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.\n","And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and He \nremoved the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from \nhis people; there remained not one.\n","And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. {P}\n"]
