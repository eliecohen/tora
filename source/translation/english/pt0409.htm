["And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in \nthe first month of the second year after they were come out of the land \nof Egypt, saying:\n","'Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.\n","In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it \nin its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and \naccording to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.'\n","And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.\n","And they kept the passover in the first month, on the \nfourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; \naccording to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of \nIsrael.\n","But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body \nof a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they\n came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.\n","And those men said unto him: 'We are unclean by the dead body \nof a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the \noffering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of \nIsrael?'\n","And Moses said unto them: 'Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.' {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you \nor of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be \nin a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD;\n","in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;\n","they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone\n thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep \nit.\n","But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and \nforbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his \npeople; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed\n season, that man shall bear his sin.\n","And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the \npassover unto the LORD: according to the statute of the passover, and \naccording to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one \nstatute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.' {S}\n","And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud \ncovered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and at even \nthere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until \nmorning.\n","So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.\n","And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then \nafter that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the \ncloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.\n","At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel \njourneyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as \nthe cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.\n","And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then\n the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.\n","And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; \naccording to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and \naccording to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.\n","And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and \nwhen the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it \ncontinued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they \njourneyed.\n","Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the \ncloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of \nIsrael remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, \nthey journeyed.\n","At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the \ncommandment of the LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the \nLORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. {P}\n"]
