It is a due for ever \nthroughout their generations.\n","This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, \nand of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the \nconsecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;\n","which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that\n he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the\n LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai. {P}\n"]
