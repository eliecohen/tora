["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children \nof Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which the LORD hath \ncommanded, saying:\n","What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth \nan ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the \ncamp,\n","and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, \nto present it as an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the \nLORD, blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that\n man shall be cut off from among his people.\n","To the end that the children of Israel may bring their \nsacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may \nbring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the\n priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto the \nLORD.\n","And the priest shall dash the blood against the altar of the \nLORD at the door of the tent of meeting, and make the fat smoke for a \nsweet savour unto the LORD.\n","And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the \nsatyrs, after whom they go astray. This shall be a statute for ever unto\n them throughout their generations.\n","And thou shalt say unto them: Whatsoever man there be of the \nhouse of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that \noffereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,\n","and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to \nsacrifice it unto the LORD, even that man shall be cut off from his \npeople.\n","And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the \nstrangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I \nwill set My face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him \noff from among his people.\n","For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it\n to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the \nblood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.\n","Therefore I said unto the children of Israel: No soul of you \nshall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you \neat blood.\n","And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of \nthe strangers that sojourn among them, that taketh in hunting any beast \nor fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and \ncover it with dust.\n","For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one \nwith the life thereof; therefore I said unto the children of Israel: Ye \nshall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is \nthe blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.\n","And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that\n which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he \nshall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until\n the even; then shall he be clean.\n","But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity. {P}\n"]
