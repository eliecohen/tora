["And the famine was sore in the land.\n","And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they\n had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them: 'Go again, \nbuy us a little food.'\n","And Judah spoke unto him, saying: 'The man did earnestly \nforewarn us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be \nwith you.\n","If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;\n","but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man\n said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with \nyou.'\n","And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?'\n","And they said: 'The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, \nand concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye \nanother brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words; \ncould we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?'\n","And Judah said unto Israel his father: 'Send the lad with me, \nand we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and \nthou, and also our little ones.\n","I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if\n I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear \nthe blame for ever.\n","For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.'\n","And their father Israel said unto them: 'If it be so now, do \nthis: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry \ndown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and \nladanum, nuts, and almonds;\n","and take double money in your hand; and the money that was \nreturned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; \nperadventure it was an oversight;\n","take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man;\n","and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may \nrelease unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be\n bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.'\n","And the men took that present, and they took double money in \ntheir hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood\n before Joseph.\n","And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward\n of his house: 'Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and \nprepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.'\n","And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.\n","And the men were afraid, because they were brought into \nJoseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned \nin our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek \noccasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our \nasses.'\n","And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house,\n","and said: 'Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food.\n","And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that \nwe opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of \nhis sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our \nhand.\n","And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.'\n","And he said: 'Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God\n of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your \nmoney.' And he brought Simeon out unto them.\n","And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\n water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n","And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n","And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which \nwas in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth.\n","And he asked them of their welfare, and said: 'Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?'\n","And they said: 'Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.' And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.\n","And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his \nmother's son, and said: 'Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke \nunto me?' And he said: 'God be gracious unto thee, my son.'\n","And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his \nbrother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, \nand wept there.\n","And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: 'Set on bread.'\n","And they set on for him by himself, and for them by \nthemselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves;\n because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is\n an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n","And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his \nbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men \nmarvelled one with another.\n","And portions were taken unto them from before him; but \nBenjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they \ndrank, and were merry with him.\n"]
