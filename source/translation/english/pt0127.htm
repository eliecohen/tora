["And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were\n dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said \nunto him: 'My son'; and he said unto him: 'Here am I.'\n","And he said: 'Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.\n","Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison;\n","and make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.'\n","And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n","And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying: 'Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying:\n","Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.\n","Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice according to that which I command thee.\n","Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of \nthe goats; and I will make them savoury food for thy father, such as he \nloveth;\n","and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.'\n","And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother: 'Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.\n","My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him \nas a mocker; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.'\n","And his mother said unto him: 'Upon me be thy curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.'\n","And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.\n","And Rebekah took the choicest garments of Esau her elder son, \nwhich were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger \nson.\n","And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.\n","And she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n","And he came unto his father, and said: 'My father'; and he said: 'Here am I; who art thou, my son?'\n","And Jacob said unto his father: 'I am Esau thy first-born; I \nhave done according as thou badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat \nof my venison, that thy soul may bless me.'\n","And Isaac said unto his son: 'How is it that thou hast found \nit so quickly, my son?' And he said: 'Because the LORD thy God sent me \ngood speed.'\n","And Isaac said unto Jacob: 'Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.'\n","And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, \nand said: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands \nof Esau.'\n","And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.\n","And he said: 'Art thou my very son Esau?' And he said: 'I am.'\n","And he said: 'Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's \nvenison, that my soul may bless thee.' And he brought it near to him, \nand he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n","And his father Isaac said unto him: 'Come near now, and kiss me, my son.'\n","And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of \nhis raiment, and blessed him, and said: See, the smell of my son is as \nthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed.\n","So God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fat places of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.\n","Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be lord \nover thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be\n every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth \nthee.\n","And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of \nblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of \nIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n","And he also made savoury food, and brought it unto his father;\n and he said unto his father: 'Let my father arise, and eat of his son's\n venison, that thy soul may bless me.'\n","And Isaac his father said unto him: 'Who art thou?' And he said: 'I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.'\n","And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said: 'Who then is he\n that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all \nbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.'\n","When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an \nexceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father: 'Bless me, \neven me also, O my father.'\n","And he said: 'Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.'\n","And he said: 'Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath \nsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, \nnow he hath taken away my blessing.' And he said: 'Hast thou not \nreserved a blessing for me?'\n","And Isaac answered and said unto Esau: 'Behold, I have made \nhim thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and\n with corn and wine have I sustained him; and what then shall I do for \nthee, my son?'\n","And Esau said unto his father: 'Hast thou but one blessing, my\n father? bless me, even me also, O my father.' And Esau lifted up his \nvoice, and wept.\n","And Isaac his father answered and said unto him: Behold, of \nthe fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of \nheaven from above;\n","And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy \nbrother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose, that \nthou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.\n","And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his \nfather blessed him. And Esau said in his heart: 'Let the days of \nmourning for my father be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.'\n","And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and \nshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him: 'Behold, \nthy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to \nkill thee.\n","Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;\n","and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;\n","until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget \nthat which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and fetch thee from \nthence; why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?'\n","And Rebekah said to Isaac: 'I am weary of my life because of \nthe daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, \nsuch as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do \nme?'\n"]
