["Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.\n","And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, three \nflocks of sheep lying there by it.--For out of that well they watered \nthe flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.\n","And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the \nstone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone \nback upon the well's mouth in its place.--\n","And Jacob said unto them: 'My brethren, whence are ye?' And they said: 'Of Haran are we.'\n","And he said unto them: 'Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?' And they said: 'We know him.'\n","And he said unto them: 'Is it well with him?' And they said: \n'It is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.'\n","And he said: 'Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that \nthe cattle should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go and \nfeed them.'\n","And they said: 'We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered \ntogether, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water \nthe sheep.'\n","While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she tended them.\n","And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of \nLaban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,\n that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and \nwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n","And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n","And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.\n","And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\n sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed \nhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\n","And Laban said to him: 'Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month.\n","And Laban said unto Jacob: 'Because thou art my brother, \nshouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy \nwages be?'\n","Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n","And Leah's eyes were weak; but Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon.\n","And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said: 'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.'\n","And Laban said: 'It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.'\n","And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n","And Jacob said unto Laban: 'Give me my wife, for my days are filled, that I may go in unto her.'\n","And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n","And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n","And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\n","And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah; \nand he said to Laban: 'What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I \nserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?'\n","And Laban said: 'It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.\n","Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other \nalso for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other \nyears.'\n","And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.\n","And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.\n","And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n","And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.\n","And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name \nReuben; for she said: 'Because the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; \nfor now my husband will love me.'\n","And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Because \nthe LORD hath heard that I am hated, He hath therefore given me this son\n also.' And she called his name Simeon.\n","And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: 'Now this \ntime will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three \nsons.' Therefore was his name called Levi.\n","And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said: 'This \ntime will I praise the LORD.' Therefore she called his name Judah; and \nshe left off bearing.\n"]
