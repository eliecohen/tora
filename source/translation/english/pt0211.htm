["And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Yet one plague more will I bring\n upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence; when\n he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.\n","Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man\n of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, \nand jewels of gold.'\n","And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the \nEgyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, \nin the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. {S}\n","And Moses said: 'Thus saith the LORD: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt;\n","and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the\n first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the \nfirst-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the \nfirst-born of cattle.\n","And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of \nEgypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any \nmore.\n","But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet \nhis tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know how that the LORD \ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n","And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow \ndown unto me, saying: Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee;\n and after that I will go out.' And he went out from Pharaoh in hot \nanger. {S}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.'\n","And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and \nthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of \nIsrael go out of his land. {S}\n"]
