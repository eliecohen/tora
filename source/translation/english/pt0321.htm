["And the LORD said unto Moses: Speak unto the priests the sons \nof Aaron, and say unto them: There shall none defile himself for the \ndead among his people;\n","except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and \nfor his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his \nbrother;\n","and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself.\n","He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.\n","They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall \nthey shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in \ntheir flesh.\n","They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of \ntheir God; for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the bread of \ntheir God, they do offer; therefore they shall be holy.\n","They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; \nneither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is \nholy unto his God.\n","Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of\n thy God; he shall be holy unto thee; for I the LORD, who sanctify you, \nam holy.\n","And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by \nplaying the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with \nfire. {S}\n","And the priest that is highest among his brethren, upon whose \nhead the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the \ngarments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his \nclothes;\n","neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;\n","neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the \nsanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his \nGod is upon him: I am the LORD.\n","And he shall take a wife in her virginity.\n","A widow, or one divorced, or a profaned woman, or a harlot, \nthese shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to\n wife.\n","And he shall not profane his seed among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctify him. {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto Aaron, saying: Whosoever he be of thy seed \nthroughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach \nto offer the bread of his God.\n","For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not \napproach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath any thing maimed, or \nanything too long,\n","or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,\n","or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath his eye overspread, or is scabbed, or scurvy, or hath his stones crushed;\n","no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, \nshall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire; he hath\n a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.\n","He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.\n","Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the \naltar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not My holy places; \nfor I am the LORD who sanctify them.\n","So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. {P}\n"]
