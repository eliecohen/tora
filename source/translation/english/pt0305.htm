["And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration,\n he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter \nit, then he shall bear his iniquity;\n","or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the \ncarcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the \ncarcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from \nhim that he is unclean;\n","or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his \nuncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; and, \nwhen he knoweth of it, be guilty;\n","or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do \ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and \nit be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty in one of \nthese things;\n","and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;\n","and he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD for his sin which \nhe hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a \nsin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning \nhis sin.\n","And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring \nhis forfeit for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two \nyoung pigeons, unto the LORD: one for a sin-offering, and the other for a\n burnt-offering.\n","And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that \nwhich is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head close by its\n neck, but shall not divide it asunder.\n","And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the\n side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at \nthe base of the altar; it is a sin-offering.\n","And he shall prepare the second for a burnt-offering, \naccording to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him \nas concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. {S}\n","But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young\n pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that wherein he hath \nsinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he \nshall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon;\n for it is a sin-offering.\n","And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\n his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke on \nthe altar, upon the offerings of the LORD made by fire; it is a \nsin-offering.\n","And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his \nsin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be \nforgiven; and the remnant shall be the priest's, as the meal-offering. {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","If any one commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the \nholy things of the LORD, then he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a\n ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation in \nsilver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a \nguilt-offering.\n","And he shall make restitution for that which he hath done \namiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give \nit unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the\n ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven. {P}\n","And if any one sin, and do any of the things which the LORD \nhath commanded not to be done, though he know it not, yet is he guilty, \nand shall bear his iniquity.\n","And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, \naccording to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and \nthe priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error which he \ncommitted, though he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.\n","It is a guilt-offering--he is certainly guilty before the LORD. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and \ndeal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or\n of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbour;\n","or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, \nand swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning \ntherein;\n","then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he \nshall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath \ngotten by oppression, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or \nthe lost thing which he found,\n","or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely, he shall even \nrestore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto; unto him \nto whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being \nguilty.\n","And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a ram without \nblemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a \nguilt-offering, unto the priest.\n","And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, \nand he shall be forgiven, concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be \nguilty thereby. {P}\n"]
