["And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.\n","And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: 'She is my sister.' And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n","But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to \nhim: 'Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken;\n for she is a man's wife.'\n","Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said: 'LORD, wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation?\n","Said he not himself unto me: She is my sister? and she, even \nshe herself said: He is my brother. In the simplicity of my heart and \nthe innocency of my hands have I done this.'\n","And God said unto him in the dream: 'Yea, I know that in the \nsimplicity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee \nfrom sinning against Me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n","Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and \nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her \nnot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are \nthine.'\n","And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his \nservants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore\n afraid.\n","Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him: 'What hast \nthou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou \nhast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds \nunto me that ought not to be done.'\n","And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?'\n","And Abraham said: 'Because I thought: Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n","And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife.\n","And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my \nfather's house, that I said unto her: This is thy kindness which thou \nshalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me: He \nis my brother.'\n","And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and \nwomen-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his \nwife.\n","And Abimelech said: 'Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.'\n","And unto Sarah he said: 'Behold, I have given thy brother a \nthousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes\n to all that are with thee; and before all men thou art righted.'\n","And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children.\n","For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. {S}\n"]
