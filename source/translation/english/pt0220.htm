["And God spoke all these words, saying: {S}\n","I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of \nEgypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before\n Me.\n","Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of\n likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth\n beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;\n","thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I the \nLORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon\n the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me;\n","and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments. {S}\n","Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for \nthe LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. {P}\n","Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n","Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;\n","but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it \nthou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy \ndaughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor\n thy stranger that is within thy gates;\n","for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and \nall that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the LORD \nblessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. {S}\n","Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. {S}\n","Thou shalt not murder. {S} Thou shalt not commit adultery. {S} Thou shalt not steal. {S} Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. {S}\n","Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; {S} thou \nshalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his \nmaid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy \nneighbour's. {P}\n","And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the \nlightnings, and the voice of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and \nwhen the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.\n","And they said unto Moses: 'Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.'\n","And Moses said unto the people: 'Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not.'\n","And the people stood afar off; but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. {S}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: Thus thou shalt say unto the \nchildren of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you \nfrom heaven.\n","Ye shall not make with Me--gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.\n","An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice\n thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and \nthine oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will \ncome unto thee and bless thee.\n","And if thou make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it\n of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast \nprofaned it.\n","Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon. {P}\n"]
