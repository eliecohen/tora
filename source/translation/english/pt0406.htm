["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When \neither man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to\n consecrate himself unto the LORD,\n","he shall abstain from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no \nvinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any \nliquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.\n","All the days of his Naziriteship shall he eat nothing that is \nmade of the grape-vine, from the pressed grapes even to the grapestone.\n","All the days of his vow of Naziriteship there shall no razor \ncome upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, in which he \nconsecrateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, he shall let the \nlocks of the hair of his head grow long.\n","All the days that he consecrateth himself unto the LORD he shall not come near to a dead body.\n","He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his \nmother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his \nconsecration unto God is upon his head.\n","All the days of his Naziriteship he is holy unto the LORD.\n","And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile his \nconsecrated head, then he shall shave his head in the day of his \ncleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.\n","And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.\n","And the priest shall prepare one for a sin-offering, and the \nother for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he \nsinned by reason of the dead; and he shall hallow his head that same \nday.\n","And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his \nNaziriteship, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year for a \nguilt-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his \nconsecration was defiled.\n","And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his \nconsecration are fulfilled: he shall bring it unto the door of the tent \nof meeting;\n","and he shall present his offering unto the LORD, one he-lamb \nof the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb\n of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram \nwithout blemish for peace-offerings,\n","and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled \nwith oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and their \nmeal-offering, and their drink-offerings.\n","And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering.\n","And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings \nunto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall \noffer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.\n","And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door \nof the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head,\n and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.\n","And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is \nsodden, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened \nwafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath \nshaven his consecrated head.\n","And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the \nLORD; this is holy for the priest, together with the breast of waving \nand the thigh of heaving; and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.\n","This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his \noffering unto the LORD for his Naziriteship, beside that for which his \nmeans suffice; according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after\n the law of his Naziriteship. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them: {S}\n","The LORD bless thee, and keep thee; {S}\n","The LORD make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; {S}\n","The LORD lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. {S}\n","So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.' {S}\n"]
