["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD, and died;\n","and the LORD said unto Moses: 'Speak unto Aaron thy brother, \nthat he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, \nbefore the ark-cover which is upon the ark; that he die not; for I \nappear in the cloud upon the ark-cover.\n","Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.\n","He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the \nlinen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen \ngirdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired; they are the holy \ngarments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.\n","And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel\n two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.\n","And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which \nis for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.\n","And he shall take the two goats, and set them before the LORD at the door of the tent of meeting.\n","And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel.\n","And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for the LORD, and offer him for a sin-offering.\n","But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set \nalive before the LORD, to make atonement over him, to send him away for \nAzazel into the wilderness.\n","And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which\n is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his \nhouse, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for \nhimself.\n","And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the \naltar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small,\n and bring it within the veil.\n","And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, \nthat the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the \ntestimony, that he die not.\n","And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it\n with his finger upon the ark-cover on the east; and before the \nark-cover shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.\n","Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for \nthe people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood \nas he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the \nark-cover, and before the ark-cover.\n","And he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the\n uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their \ntransgressions, even all their sins; and so shall he do for the tent of \nmeeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.\n","And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth\n in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have \nmade atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the \nassembly of Israel.\n","And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, \nand make atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, \nand of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar \nround about.\n","And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger \nseven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the\n children of Israel.\n","And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, \nand the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat.\n","And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live \ngoat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,\n and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put \nthem upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of \nan appointed man into the wilderness.\n","And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a \nland which is cut off; and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.\n","And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put \noff the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy \nplace, and shall leave them there.\n","And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place and put \non his other vestments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and\n the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and \nfor the people.\n","And the fat of the sin-offering shall he make smoke upon the altar.\n","And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his \nclothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into \nthe camp.\n","And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the \nsin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy \nplace, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in \nthe fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.\n","And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.\n","And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh \nmonth, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and \nshall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that \nsojourneth among you.\n","For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the LORD.\n","It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.\n","And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be \nconsecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the \natonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments.\n","And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and he \nshall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he \nshall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the \nassembly.\n","And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make \natonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in \nthe year.' And he did as the LORD commanded Moses. {P}\n"]
