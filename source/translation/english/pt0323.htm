["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The \nappointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy \nconvocations, even these are My appointed seasons.\n","Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a \nsabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of \nwork; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings. {P}\n","These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.\n","In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the LORD'S passover.\n","And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of \nunleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened \nbread.\n","In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.\n","And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven\n days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner \nof servile work. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye \nare come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest\n thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your \nharvest unto the priest.\n","And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.\n","And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a \nhe-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the \nLORD.\n","And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an \nephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the \nLORD for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of \nwine, the fourth part of a hin.\n","And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh \nears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of \nyour God; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all \nyour dwellings. {S}\n","And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of \nrest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks \nshall there be complete;\n","even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto the LORD.\n","Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two \ntenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be \nbaked with leaven, for first-fruits unto the LORD.\n","And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without \nblemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they \nshall be a burnt-offering unto the LORD, with their meal-offering, and \ntheir drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour \nunto the LORD.\n","And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.\n","And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the \nfirst-fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; \nthey shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.\n","And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there \nshall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile \nwork; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your \ngenerations.\n","And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not \nwholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the \ngleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the\n stranger: I am the LORD your God. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh \nmonth, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a\n memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation.\n","Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD. {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of \natonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall \nafflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the\n LORD.\n","And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a\n day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.\n","For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.\n","And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.\n","Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n","It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall \nafflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even \nunto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth \nday of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days \nunto the LORD.\n","On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.\n","Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the \nLORD; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye \nshall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a day of \nsolemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.\n","These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall \nproclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto\n the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and \ndrink-offerings, each on its own day;\n","beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and \nbeside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye \ngive unto the LORD.\n","Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye \nhave gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the \nLORD seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the \neighth day shall be a solemn rest.\n","And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly \ntrees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of\n the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.\n","And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the \nyear; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in \nthe seventh month.\n","Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;\n","that your generations may know that I made the children of \nIsrael to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt:\n I am the LORD your God.\n","And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the LORD. {P}\n"]
