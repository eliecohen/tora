and wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, \nthat Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?\n","Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, \nthat Thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom, as a \nnursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou \ndidst swear unto their fathers?\n","Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people?
