["And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\n his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto \nhis place.\n","And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n","And Jacob said when he saw them: 'This is God's camp.' And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. {P}\n","And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.\n","And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord \nEsau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and \nstayed until now.\n","And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and \nmaid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour \nin thy sight.'\n","And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy \nbrother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men \nwith him.'\n","Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he \ndivided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and\n the camels, into two camps.\n","And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.'\n","And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham, and God of my \nfather Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and \nto thy kindred, and I will do thee good;\n","I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, \nwhich Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over \nthis Jordan; and now I am become two camps.\n","Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\n hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother \nwith the children.\n","And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'\n","And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:\n","two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n","thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.\n","And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every \ndrove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and \nput a space betwixt drove and drove.'\n","And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother \nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest\n thou? and whose are these before thee?\n","then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a \npresent sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is \nbehind us.'\n","And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that \nfollowed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, \nwhen ye find him;\n","and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is \nbehind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth\n before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will \naccept me.'\n","So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.\n","And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\n handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the \nJabbok.\n","And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.\n","And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.\n","And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched \nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, \nas he wrestled with him.\n","And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'\n","And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.'\n","And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but \nIsrael; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast \nprevailed.'\n","And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy \nname.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' \nAnd he blessed him there.\n","And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'\n","And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.\n","Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the \nthigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because\n he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the \nthigh-vein.\n"]
