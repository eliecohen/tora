["Thou shalt not utter a false report; put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n","Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt \nthou bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert \njustice;\n","neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause. {S}\n","If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. {S}\n","If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its \nburden, thou shalt forbear to pass by him; thou shalt surely release it \nwith him. {S}\n","Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.\n","Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked.\n","And thou shalt take no gift; for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.\n","And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n","And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in the increase thereof;\n","but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, \nthat the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beast of \nthe field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, \nand with thy oliveyard.\n","Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou \nshalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of \nthy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.\n","And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed; and \nmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out \nof thy mouth.\n","Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year.\n","The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days thou\n shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed \nin the month Abib--for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall \nappear before Me empty;\n","and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours, \nwhich thou sowest in the field; and the feast of ingathering, at the end\n of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.\n","Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.\n","Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened \nbread; neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the \nmorning.\n","The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into \nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its \nmother's milk. {P}\n","Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\n","Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; be not \nrebellious against him; for he will not pardon your transgression; for \nMy name is in him.\n","But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all \nthat I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an \nadversary unto thine adversaries.\n","For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto \nthe Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the \nHivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.\n","Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do \nafter their doings; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in \npieces their pillars.\n","And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless thy \nbread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of \nthee. {S}\n","None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil.\n","I will send My terror before thee, and will discomfit all the \npeople to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn \ntheir backs unto thee.\n","And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.\n","I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest \nthe land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against \nthee.\n","By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.\n","And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea \nof the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River; for I will \ndeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive\n them out before thee.\n","Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.\n","They shall not dwell in thy land--lest they make thee sin \nagainst Me, for thou wilt serve their gods--for they will be a snare \nunto thee. {P}\n"]
