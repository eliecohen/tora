["And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the LORD, his \noffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put \nfrankincense thereon.\n","And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall\n take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil \nthereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest \nshall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering \nmade by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n","But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's \nand his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\n by fire. {S}\n","And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it \nshall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened \nwafers spread with oil. {S}\n","And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\n","Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering. {S}\n","And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.\n","And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these \nthings unto the LORD; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he \nshall bring it unto the altar.\n","And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the \nmemorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar--an \noffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\n","But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's \nand his sons'; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\n by fire.\n","No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be\n made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as \nan offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n","As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the LORD; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar.\n","And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; \nneither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be \nlacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer \nsalt. {S}\n","And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the \nLORD, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in\n the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear.\n","And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering.\n","And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even \nof the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense\n thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. {P}\n"]
